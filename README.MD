 ### 1️⃣1️⃣  User Search Filter Cards
## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Card Creation**
   - Each user object has `name`, `pic`, and `bio`.
   - JS creates a `<div class="card">` with:
     - `<img>` for the picture
     - `.blur-layer` for glassy overlay
     - `.content` div containing `<h3>` and `<p>`.

2. **Carousel**
   - `.cards-track` uses CSS keyframes for infinite scroll.
   - Hover pauses the animation for better UX.

3. **Search Filter**
   - Input listens for `input` events.
   - Filters cards in **real-time**:
     - Empty → show carousel
     - Typed → show filtered grid layout

4. **Responsive Animations**
   - Cards scale, lift, and shadow on hover.
   - Fade-in animation on load.
   - Mobile-friendly resizing.
